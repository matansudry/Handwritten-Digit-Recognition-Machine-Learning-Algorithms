# Handwritten Digit Recognition
#Recognizing a digit in a black-white image is a relatively simple task: the input consists of black and white pixels, the digits are well separated from the background, and there are only ten possible output categories.
#Yet, this task deals with mapping from the 2-dimensional image space onto the category space and thus this task has considerable complexity. MNIST is the most widely used benchmark for isolated digit recognition. This is the dataset we used. In this project, we will attempt to build a structured model and machine learning algorithm that will give better performance compared to KNN algorithm. We started the 1st part with the assumption that there is no relationship between the nodes, so we take Na√Øve Bayes- NB algorithm. The accuracy was 75% compared to 93.41% that KNN gave. In the 2nd part we thought which structured algorithm can improve our results and we found LBP and used NB as the initiating values for the factors. This fusion of the 2 algorithms gave us accuracy of 83.74% when we used only 1 iteration and the accuracy decreased when we did more iterations. In the 3rd part we thought about the problems of all the algorithms we used and concluded that all of them should have big training data. From this need we developed a new algorithm that takes the edges with the highest and lowest probabilities for each label. In this part, all of the algorithms got only 1 image from each label and the new algorithm gave the highest performance with 48.77%.
